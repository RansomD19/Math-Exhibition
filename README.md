* Cut out 3 rectangles from box board.

* Cut short slits in each of the corners.

* Cut a slit down the middle of each one. You might need to make these slits wider.

* Slip the 3 rectangles together through the slits.

* Tape some thread to one of the corners and connect the thread to all neighboring slits till you have an icosahedron.
